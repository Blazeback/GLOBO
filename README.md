# GLOBO
A school network programming project in which I made a 1 vs. 1 player game about balloons in which each players controlls one and has to pop the oppossing player by using a pointy weapon. The co-op version is run locally, while the network (Red) version can be played with two computers connected to the same network.

Made in Java.
